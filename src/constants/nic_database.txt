Section U: Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies
  Division 99: Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies Group 990 Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies Part-II
    Group 011: Growing of non-perennial crops This group includes the growing of non-perennial crops, i.e. plants that do not last for more than two growing seasons. Included is the growing of these plants for the purpose of seed production.
    Group 012: Growing of perennial crops
    Group 013: Plant propagation
    Group 014: Animal production This group includes raising (farming) and breeding of all animals, except aquatic animals. This group excludes:
    Group 015: Mixed farming
    Group 016: Support activities to agriculture and post-harvest crop activities This group includes activities incidental to agricultural production and activities similar to agriculture not undertaken for production purposes (in the sense of harvesting agricultural products), done on a fee or
    Group 017: Hunting, trapping and related service activities 02 Forestry and logging This division includes the production of roundwood for the forest-based manufacturing industries (ISIC divisions 16 and 17) as well as the extraction and gathering of wild growing non-wood forest products. Besides the production of timber, forestry activities result in products that undergo little processing, such as firewood, charcoal, wood chips and roundwood used in an unprocessed form (e.g. pit-props, pulpwood etc.). These activities can be carried out in natural or planted forests.
    Group 021: Silviculture and other forestry activities
    Group 022: Logging
    Group 023: Gathering of non-wood forest products
    Group 024: Support services to forestry 03   Fishing and aquaculture This division includes capture fishery and aquaculture, covering the use of fishery resources from marine, brackish or freshwater environments, with the goal of capturing or gathering fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other marine organisms and products (e.g. aquatic plants, pearls, sponges etc). Also included are activities that are normally integrated in the process of production for own account (e.g. seeding oysters for pearl production). This division does not include building and repairing of ships and boats (3011, 3315) and sport or recreational fishing activities (9319). Processing of fish, crustaceans or molluscs is excluded, whether at land-based plants or on factory ships (1020).
    Group 031: Fishing This group includes “capture fishery”, i.e. the hunting, collecting and gathering activities directed at removing or collecting live wild aquatic organisms (predominantly fish, molluscs and crustaceans) including plants from the oceanic, coastal or inland waters for human consumption and other purposes by hand or more usually by various types of fishing gear such as nets, lines and stationary traps. Such activities can be conducted on the intertidal shoreline (e.g. collection of molluscs such as mussels and oysters) or shore based netting, or from home-made dugouts or more commonly using commercially made boats in inshore, coastal waters or offshore waters. Unlike in aquaculture (group 032), the aquatic resource being captured is usually common property resource irrespective of whether the harvest from this resource is undertaken with or without exploitation rights. Such activities also include fishing restocked water bodies.
    Group 032: Aquaculture This group includes “aquaculture” (or aqua farming), i.e. the production process involving the culturing or farming (including harvesting) of aquatic organisms (fish, molluscs, crustaceans, plants, crocodiles, alligators and amphibians) using techniques designed to increase the production of the organisms in question beyond the natural capacity of the environment (for example regular stocking, feeding and protection from predators). Culturing/farming refers to the rearing up to their juvenile and/or adult phase under captive conditions of the above organisms. In addition, “aquaculture” also encompasses individual, corporate or state ownership of the individual organisms throughout the rearing or culture stage, up to and including harvesting.
    Group 051: Mining of hard coal
    Group 052: Mining of lignite 06 Extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas This division includes the production of crude petroleum, the mining and extraction of oil from oil shale and oil sand the production of natural gas and recovery of hydrocarbon liquids. This division includes the activities of operating and/or developing oil and gas field properties. Such activities may include drilling, completing and equipping wells; operating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment and field gathering lines for crude petroleum and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing. This division includes the production of oil, the mining and extraction of oil from oil shale and oil sands and the production of gas and hydrocarbon liquids, through gasification, liquefaction and pyrolysis of coal at the mine site.
    Group 061: Extraction of crude petroleum
    Group 062: Extraction of natural gas 07 Mining of metal ores This division includes mining for metallic minerals (ores), performed through underground or open-cast extraction, seabed mining etc. Also included are ore dressing and beneficiating operations, such as crushing, grinding, washing, drying, sintering, calcining or leaching ore, gravity separation or flotation operations. This division excludes:
    Group 071: Mining of iron ores
    Group 072: Mining of non-ferrous metal ores This group includes the mining of non-ferrous metal ores. 08   Other mining and quarrying This division includes extraction from a mine or quarry, but also dredging of alluvial deposits, rock crushing and the use of salt marshes. The products are used most notably in construction (e.g. sands, stones etc.), manufacture of materials (e.g. clay, gypsum, calcium etc.), manufacture of chemicals etc. This division does not include processing (except crushing, grinding, cutting, cleaning, drying, sorting and mixing) of the minerals extracted.
    Group 081: Quarrying of stone, sand and clay
    Group 089: Mining and quarrying n.e.c. 09 Mining support service activities This division includes specialized support services incidental to mining provided on a fee or contract basis. It includes exploration services through traditional prospecting methods such as taking core samples and making geological observations as well as drilling, test-drilling or redrilling for oil wells, metallic and non- metallic minerals. Other typical services cover building oil and gas well foundations, cementing oil and gas well casings, cleaning, bailing and swabbing oil and gas wells, draining and pumping mines, overburden removal services at mines, etc.

Section X: “Activities not Adequately Defined”. The activities relating to Repair Services, which were provided for in two places viz. Division Y and 9 (major group 97) of NIC 1970, had been placed only at Division 97 of NIC 1987, thereby dropping the special Division Y in the revised NIC. At the two digit level there had been an expansion of 8 divisions bringing it to 72 divisions as against 64 in NIC 1970. Of the eight additional two digit codes, three were in Mining and Quarrying Section, with one each in Manufacturing (Repair of Capital goods) and Electricity (Generation of non-conventional energy) Sections and the remaining three in the Section relating to Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services. Similarly, the three digit level categories were also increased to meet the requirement of more detailed activities, which had become important in the intervening period. Finally, in order to differentiate the scale and / or technologies of operation and also to take into account the product specialization, four digit classification appeared through out in NIC-1987; unlike in case of NIC-1970 where four digit classification was developed only for the sections dealing with mining and manufacturing. There was an expansion at the 3-digit level making a total of 461 as compared to 383 in NIC 1970. The number of four digit level categories in NIC 1987 was 918 as against 590 in NIC 1970. 18. With the advent of ISIC Rev.3 in 1990, at the international panorama to enfold the changes in the organization of economic activities on account of technological evolution and to capture the emergence of new activities especially in the services sector, since the last classification, it was exigent to review and revise NIC 1987.
